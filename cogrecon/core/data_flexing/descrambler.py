    This descrambler performs a very specific task as requested by a researcher. It first prompts for the selection
    of a particular directory. It searches that directory for files (any file) and parses that file as a TSV.
    The TSV is expected to have a final element on each line which represents the order the line is actually
    meant to be in. The file is, thus, reordered according to this last element (assumed to be an integer).

    The result is written to an output path which is the input path with descrambled prepended to the filename.
