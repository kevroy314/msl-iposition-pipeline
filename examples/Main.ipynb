    "\n",
    "The process is as follows:\n",
    "1. Use helper function, [generate_random_test_points](https://msl-iposition-pipeline.readthedocs.io/en/latest/source/cogrecon.core.html#cogrecon.core.tools.generate_random_test_points), to generate actual and test coordinates.\n",
    "2. Create a [ParticipantData](https://msl-iposition-pipeline.readthedocs.io/en/latest/source/cogrecon.core.html#cogrecon.core.data_structures.ParticipantData) object populated with a list containing a single [TrialData](https://msl-iposition-pipeline.readthedocs.io/en/latest/source/cogrecon.core.html#cogrecon.core.data_structures.TrialData) object (i.e. one participant with one trial).\n",
    "3. Create an [AnalysisConfiguration](https://msl-iposition-pipeline.readthedocs.io/en/latest/source/cogrecon.core.html#cogrecon.core.data_structures.AnalysisConfiguration) object which contains the configuration information for how the analysis should be run.\n",
    "4. Call the [full_pipeline](https://msl-iposition-pipeline.readthedocs.io/en/latest/source/cogrecon.core.html#cogrecon.core.full_pipeline.full_pipeline) function with the data and configuration and ask it to visualize the result.\n",
    "\n",
    "This process could then be run in a loop if desired over any data of interest, however, as will be shown in the next section, the [batch_pipeline](https://msl-iposition-pipeline.readthedocs.io/en/latest/source/cogrecon.core.html#cogrecon.core.batch_pipeline.batch_pipeline) function provides a variety of functionality to make this largely unnecessary.\n",

    "# Batch Pipeline Test\n",
    "This section tests the Batch Pipeline, which runs on a folder full of data files, automatically finding the appropriate files. The process is as follows:\n",
    "1. Produce a UI window for selection of a directory.\n",
    "2. Once a valid directory has been selected, run the [batch_pipeline](https://msl-iposition-pipeline.readthedocs.io/en/latest/source/cogrecon.core.html#cogrecon.core.batch_pipeline.batch_pipeline) command on the directory.\n",

    "Note that the [batch_pipeline](https://msl-iposition-pipeline.readthedocs.io/en/latest/source/cogrecon.core.html#cogrecon.core.batch_pipeline.batch_pipeline) function has a variety of options to make locating and processing large groups of files easier. Some of the more critical inputs are:\n",
    "* **trial_by_trial_accuracy** - if *True*, the accuracy windows are calculated on individual trials; otherwise, the accuracy windows are computed using the entire participant's data at once (this is generally preferred and is default)\n",
    "* **collapse_trials** - if *True*, one row per participant will be produced in the output; otherwise, each trial will get its own row (note that this does not impact whether or not the accuracy is being computed on a per-trial or per-participant basis)\n",
    "* **removal_dim_indicies** - this parameter takes a list of dimension indicies which will be excluded from the analysis (i.e. if the data is 3D, and only the first and third dimensions should be analyzed, the input could be *removal_dim_indicies=[1]*)\n",
    "* **actual_coordinate_prefixes** - if *True*, it is assumed that there will be a *\\*actual_coordinates.txt* file for every *\\*position_data_coordinates.txt* file; otherwise, only one *actual_coordinates.txt* file is expected\n",
    "* **\\_data_coodinates_file_suffix**, **\\_actual_coordinates_file_suffix** - these provide the search string for finding files of each type (i.e. *position_data_coordinates.txt* and *actual_coordinates.txt*)\n",

    "Note: The [batch_pipeline](https://msl-iposition-pipeline.readthedocs.io/en/latest/source/cogrecon.core.html#cogrecon.core.batch_pipeline.batch_pipeline) function can produce a significant number of logged outputs (mostly warnings about transformation functions).
